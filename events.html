	  <p class="engagement_text" style="text-align: left"><span class="inclusive-sans-bold">How long can I perform?</span></br>Each act gets a maximum of 10 minutes, including setup time.

	  <p class="engagement_text" style="text-align: left"><span class="inclusive-sans-bold">Can I use backing tracks?</span></br>Yes, you can use backing tracks as long as they feature your own original work or arrangements. No karaoke tracks, please – we are planning separate events for karaoke!</p>
	  <p class="engagement_text" style="text-align: left"><span class="inclusive-sans-bold">Can I promote my music/social media/website during my set?</span></br>Yes! If you wish, please do let the audience know where they can find you online and hear more of your music.</p>

"Documents of absence" explores the philosophical terrain of people, stories, and issues that remain outside our daily consciousness. </br></br>This project seeks to resonate with the notion of overlooked communities. Those so often reduced to stereotypes of weakness, poverty, or fragmentation by the narrow lens we are conditioned to see through. </br></br>In reality, these individuals and groups possess extraordinary strength: the ability to endure daily hardship, to forge connections and resilience within impermanence. </br></br>The act of building and sustaining community under conditions of displacement is not a sign of lack, but a kind of superpower - one that those untouched by such adversity may never fully comprehend. </br></br>This is an invitation to stop and spend time with these overlooked stories. To make visible what has been obscured, and open the door to a different kind of conversation.</p>
